Abstract: We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and
temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos,
but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies,
such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented
at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural
network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast,
GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the
pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating
the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with
the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that
GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to
infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus
all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing
the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera
control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view
novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and
monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos.

## Installation
Please follow the "Inference" section in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to set up your environment.

## Inference

### Download checkpoints
1. Generate a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) access token (if you haven't done so already). Set the access token to `Read` permission (default is `Fine-grained`).

2. Log in to Hugging Face with the access token:
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

3. Download the GEN3C model weights from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/GEN3C-Cosmos-7B):
   ```bash
   CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python scripts/download_gen3c_checkpoints.py --checkpoint_dir checkpoints
   ```

### Interactive GUI usage

<div align="center">
  <img src="gui/assets/gui_preview.webp" alt="GEN3C interactive GUI"  width="1080px"/>
</div>

GEN3C can be used through an interactive GUI, allowing to visualize the inputs in 3D, author arbitrary camera trajectories, and start inference from a single window.
Please see the [dedicated instructions](gui/README.md).


### Command-line usage
GEN3C supports both images and videos as input. Below are examples of running GEN3C on single images and videos with predefined camera trajectory patterns.

### Example 1: Single Image to Video Generation

#### Single GPU
Generate a 121-frame video from a single image:
```bash
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_single_image.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --input_image_path assets/diffusion/000000.png \
    --video_save_name test_single_image \
    --guidance 1 \
    --foreground_masking
```

#### Multi-GPU (8 GPUs)
```bash
NUM_GPUS=8
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) torchrun --nproc_per_node=${NUM_GPUS} cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_single_image.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --input_image_path assets/diffusion/000000.png \
    --video_save_name test_single_image_multigpu \
    --num_gpus ${NUM_GPUS} \
    --guidance 1 \
    --foreground_masking
```

#### Additional Options
- To generate longer videos autoregressively, specify the number of frames using `--num_video_frames`. The number of frames must follow the pattern: 121 * N - 1 (e.g., 241, 361, etc.)
- To save buffer images alongside the output video, add the `--save_buffer` flag
- You can control camera trajectories using `--trajectory`, `--camera_rotation`, and `--movement_distance` arguments. See the "Camera Movement Options" section below for details.

#### Camera Movement Options

##### Trajectory Types
The `--trajectory` argument controls the path the camera takes during video generation. Available options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `left` | Camera moves to the left (default) |
| `right` | Camera moves to the right |
| `up` | Camera moves upward |
| `down` | Camera moves downward |
| `zoom_in` | Camera moves closer to the scene |
| `zoom_out` | Camera moves away from the scene |
| `clockwise` | Camera moves in a clockwise circular path |
| `counterclockwise` | Camera moves in a counterclockwise circular path |

##### Camera Rotation Modes
The `--camera_rotation` argument controls how the camera rotates during movement. Available options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `center_facing` | Camera always rotates to look at the (estimated) center of the scene (default) |
| `no_rotation` | Camera maintains its original orientation while moving |
| `trajectory_aligned` | Camera rotates to align with the direction of movement |

##### Movement Distance
The `--movement_distance` argument controls how far the camera moves from its initial position. The default value is 0.3. A larger value will result in more dramatic camera movement, while a smaller value will create more subtle movement.

##### GPU Memory Requirements

We have tested GEN3C only on H100 and A100 GPUs. For GPUs with limited memory, you can fully offload all models by appending the following flags to your command:

```bash
--offload_diffusion_transformer \
--offload_tokenizer \
--offload_text_encoder_model \
--offload_prompt_upsampler \
--offload_guardrail_models \
--disable_guardrail \
--disable_prompt_encoder
```
Maximum observed memory during inference with full offloading: ~43GB. Note: Memory usage may vary depending on system specifications and is provided for reference only.


### Example 2: Video to Video Generation
For video input, GEN3C requires additional depth information, camera intrinsics, and extrinsics. These can be obtained using your choice of SLAM packages. We recommend using [ViPE](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/vipe). For testing purposes, we provide example data.

First, you need to download the test samples:
```bash
# Download test samples from Hugging Face
huggingface-cli download nvidia/GEN3C-Testing-Example --repo-type dataset --local-dir assets/diffusion/dynamic_video_samples
```

#### Single GPU
```bash
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_dynamic.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --input_image_path assets/diffusion/dynamic_video_samples/batch_0000 \
    --video_save_name test_dynamic_video \
    --guidance 1
```

#### Multi-GPU (8 GPUs)
```bash
NUM_GPUS=8
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) torchrun --nproc_per_node=${NUM_GPUS} cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_dynamic.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --input_image_path assets/diffusion/dynamic_video_samples/batch_0000 \
    --video_save_name test_dynamic_video_multigpu \
    --num_gpus ${NUM_GPUS} \
    --guidance 1
```

#### Testing on your own videos using ViPE
Follow the installation instructions for [ViPE](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/vipe). Note: ViPE's environment is not compatible with GEN3C. We recommend installing ViPE in a separate conda environment.

1) Run ViPE to extract depth, intrinsics, and camera poses:
```bash
vipe infer YOUR_VIDEO.mp4 --output <vipe_results_dir>
```

2) Run GEN3C with the ViPE outputs:
```bash
NUM_GPUS=8
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) torchrun --nproc_per_node=${NUM_GPUS} cosmos_predict1/diffusion/inference/gen3c_dynamic.py \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --vipe_path <vipe_results_dir> \
    --vipe_starting_frame_idx 0 \
    --video_save_name gen3c_test_dynamic_vipe \
    --disable_prompt_upsampler \
    --num_gpus ${NUM_GPUS} \
    --guidance 1 \
    --num_video_frames 121
```

The generated video will span frames from `vipe_starting_frame_idx` to `vipe_starting_frame_idx + num_video_frames - 1` of the original input video. Camera motion is controlled by the options described in "Camera Movement Options" above.

### Example 3: Video Generation from Multiview Images
Similar to video input, GEN3C requires additional depth information, camera intrinsics, and extrinsics. These can be obtained using off-the-shelf methods like [VGGT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt). For testing purposes, we provide example data.

First, download the test samples:
```bash
# Download test samples from Hugging Face
huggingface-cli download nvidia/GEN3C-Testing-Example --repo-type dataset --local-dir assets/diffusion/dynamic_video_samples
```

```bash
NUM_GPUS=8
CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) torchrun --nproc_per_node=${NUM_GPUS} -m cosmos_predict1.diffusion.inference.gen3c_multiview \
    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \
    --video_save_name gen3c_test_multiview \
    --num_video_frames 361 \
    --height 704 --width 1280 \
    --npz_path assets/diffusion/dynamic_video_samples/mv_0.npz \
    --num_gpus ${NUM_GPUS} \
    --filter_points_threshold 0.05 \
    --foreground_masking --guidance 1
```
